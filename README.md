# Turning the Page: Do Libraries Help Close the Literacy Gap? 

## Project Summary
For this project, the goal was to determine if public libraries and public library funding help close the literacy gap. 

## Key Questions
<ul>
  <li>Is there a relationship between library funding and literacy rates across the U.S. counties?</li>
  <li>Do communities with higher program attendance see higher literacy rates?</li>
  <li>Do libraries with a higher check-out rate see higher literacy rates?</li>
  <li>How does income level correlate with literacy rates across communities?</li>
  <li>Are there low-income counties with unexpectedly high literacy rates – and do library resources play a role?</li>
</ul>

## Data Review
Two sets of data were used for this analysis: 
<ul>
  <li>Public Libraries Survey from the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (IMLS).</li>
  Source: https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/surveys/public-libraries-survey-pls
  <li>U.S. Skills Map: State and County Indicators of Adult Literacy and Numeracy from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in partnership with the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC).</li>
  Source: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/
</ul>

## Systems Used
Python was used for data analysis, with the following libraries: 
<ul>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Matplotlib.pyplot</li>
  <li>Folium</li>
  <li>json</li>
  <li>sklearn</li>
  <li>sklearn.model_selection</li>
  <li>sklearn.linear_model</li>
  <li>sklearn.metrics</li>
  <li>sklearn.cluster</li>
  <li>pylab</li>
  <li>statsmodels.api</li>
</ul>

## Key Takeaways
<ul>
  <li>The state with the highest percentage of low literacy individuals is Texas (10.83%).</li>
  <li>The highest density of public libraries are located in the North/Northeast region.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are employed typically fall into the "average literacy" category.</li>
  <li>There is no correlation between any government funding (local, state, federal) and literacy rates.</li>
  <li>Individuals who have a higher literacy rate have a low chance of being under the poverty rate.</li>
  <li>More analysis needs to be done.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This storyboard does not contain every step taken as part of the analysis — only steps relevant to the final results.</li>
